# These settings are inherent properties of the branch they are specified in.
# For instance, the final commit in a release branch should typically 
# change the RCE_BUILD_TYPE setting to "release", making any future build of
# this (typically tagged) commit a release build.
#
# IMPORTANT: When merging branches, make sure to check whether the merged
# settings are appropriate for the target branch. For example, make sure not to
# merge a RCE_BUILD_TYPE="release" setting back into development branches.


# Valid values are "snapshot", "rc" and "release".
# This setting currently affects:
# - the format of the version "qualifier" (=suffix) of generated packages
# - the naming of the final zip files.

RCE_BUILD_TYPE="snapshot"


# Note: This setting has no effect on the current build process, so it is purely 
# informational for now. It should still be maintained properly for future usage.

RCE_BUILD_VERSION="10.6.0"


# TODO decide whether to define the expected version of the third-party repository here,
# for example for validation at build time
