        <title>Synopsis</title>
        <para>The TiGL Viewer component opens a TiGL Viewer within RCE during workflow execution to
            provide an integrated 3D viewer for CPACS geometries. In addition, it also allows
            opening standard CAD file formats like IGES, STEP and BREP.<note>The TiGL Viewer
                component is currently only available on Windows operating systems.</note></para>

        <title>Setup</title>
        <para>The TiGL Viewer is not included in RCE anymore, but has to be downloaded and installed
            separately. Please visit <ulink url="https://dlr-sc.github.io/tigl/pages/download.html"
                >https://dlr-sc.github.io/tigl/pages/download.html</ulink> in order to obtain a
            copy. Once installed, add the following lines to your configuration file and restart
            RCE:<literallayout><code>"thirdPartyIntegration": {
    "tiglViewer" : {
        "binaryPath" : "/path/to/tiglViewer.exe"
    }
}</code></literallayout></para>
        <para>For additional configuration options for the TiGL Viewer refer to the configuration
            reference.</para>

        <title>Usage</title>
        <para>The TiGL Viewer component has no properties at all. It has a preconfigured input
            channel and a preconfigured output channel “TiGL Viewer File”.</para>
        <para>During workflow execution, the view “TiGL Viewer” will be opened during the first
            component run. In the following iterations the geometry shown in the view will be
            updated with the current input.</para>
        <para>For more information about the TiGL Viewer software, please visit <ulink
                url="http://tigl.sourceforge.net/Doc/tiglviewer.html"/>.</para>
