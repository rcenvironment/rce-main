# These settings are inherent properties of the branch they are specified in.
# For instance, the final commit in a release branch should typically 
# change the RCE_BUILD_TYPE setting to "release", making any future build of
# this (typically tagged) commit a release build.
#
# IMPORTANT: When merging branches, make sure to check whether the merged
# settings are appropriate for the target branch. For example, make sure not to
# merge a RCE_BUILD_TYPE="release" setting back into development branches.
