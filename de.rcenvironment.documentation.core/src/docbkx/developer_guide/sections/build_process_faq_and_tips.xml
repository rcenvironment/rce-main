            <question>
                <para>After running a local product build using the provided script files, where do
                    I find the generated product zips and files?</para>
            </question>
            <answer>
                <para>The generated distribution ("product") zip files are located in
                        <code>build/target/products</code> , with a matching Eclipse "update site"
                    provided in <code>build/target/products/updatesite</code>. A zipped version of
                    the update site is also available in <code>build/target/products</code>.</para>

            <question>
                <para>I created a new snapshot / RC / release build of the
                        <code>rce-thirdparty</code> repository. What do I have to edit to make the
                    product build use it?</para>
            </question>
            <answer>
                <para>Unlike before the RCE 10.6.0 release, local <code>rce-thirdparty</code> builds
                    do not require any change in the Eclipse environment used to work on the
                        <code>rce-main</code> code base. The <code>rce-thirdparty</code> builds are
                    always created in a defined location, so simply updating your "target platform"
                    definition should be sufficient.</para>

            <question>
                <para>A package import in Eclipse fails with the error message "The import xxx
                    cannot be resolved" although the imports and exports are set correctly in the
                    respective Manifest files. What else can I try to solve the problem?</para>
            </question>
            <answer>
                <para>Go to the Project Explorer and select the affected bundle. Open the context
                    menu and select "Plug-in Tools > Update Classpath...". Select all affected
                    bundles (possibly including the Fragment-Host) from the dialog list provided and
                    finish.</para>
