	As third-party software (e.g. libraries) included in RCE is constantly
	updated, it is generally recommended to always upgrading RCE to the
	latest available release. However, not every update might be strictly
	necessary. To allow RCE users and administrators to make informed
	decisions, the page
	<ulink url="https://rcenvironment.de/pages/updatessecurity.html">"Update/Security Information for RCE Releases"</ulink>
	provides an overview of the status of all public RCE releases. In
	particular, this includes information about how important it is to
	update from a certain RCE version.
