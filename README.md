RCE is a distributed, workflow-driven integration environment.
It is used by engineers and scientists to analyze, optimize, and design complex systems (e.g., aircraft, ships, or satellites).
Using RCE, they can combine their specialized design and simulation tools into distributed workflows.

The main project website is [https://rcenvironment.de/](https://rcenvironment.de/).

##### Issue Tracker

The primary issue tracking and roadmap planning for RCE's development is currently done internally at the 
[DLR Institute for Software Technology](https://www.dlr.de/sc), where the majority of development work takes place.
Please use this [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/rcenvironment/rce-main/issues) to report new issues and suggestions.
We will review them and integrate them into our internal roadmap.

Please note that there is also a [previous issue tracker](https://github.com/rcenvironment/rce/issues), which is maintained 
for historical completeness, but should not be used for new issues anymore.
